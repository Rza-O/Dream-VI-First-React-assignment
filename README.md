<li>Each player uniquely designed as a card. In each card there is a "Choose Player button". This button validates if the user has enough credit, weather the player has been added before and if selected players exceeds the limit of six.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>"Choose Player button" will add the player to the "Selected section" when it passes the validation then it changes the "Selected" sections using state.</li>
